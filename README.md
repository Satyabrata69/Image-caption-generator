# Image-caption-generator

ABSTRACT:An image caption generator is a deep learning model designed to automatically generate descriptive text for images. Combining computer vision and natural language processing, it analyzes visual content and produces accurate captions. Applications include improving accessibility, enhancing search engines, and aiding social media platforms in content description and image management. This approach improves tasks like object detection, image classification, and scene interpretation, leading to more accurate and meaningful insights from visual data.Massive web datasets play a key role in the success of large vision-language models like CLIP and Flamingo.However, the raw web data is noisy, and existing filtering methods to reduce noise often come at the expense of data diversity.Our work focuses on caption quality as one major source of noise, and studies how generated captions can increase the utility of web-scraped datapoints with nondescript text.


Importance/Motivation of the problem:-

Image captioning is a technology that creates text descriptions for images. It plays a crucial role in making content more accessible, especially for people with visual impairments, by providing descriptions that screen readers can use. This technology also enhances image search capabilities, making it easier to find specific images based on their content rather than just tags or titles. Additionally, it helps in moderating content by automatically identifying and filtering inappropriate images. 

On social media and other platforms, image captioning enriches user experience by generating captions that improve the way people share and interact with images. In education, it aids in understanding visual materials by providing clear descriptions. Overall, image captioning pushes forward advancements in artificial intelligence by combining computer vision with language processing, contributing to smarter and more effective technologies.
